`kube-batch` is a batch scheduler for Kubernetes, providing mechanisms for applications which would like to run batch jobs leveraging Kubernetes. 

`kube-batch` builds upon a decade and a half of experience on running batch workloads at scale using several systems, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the open source community.
